Stage-CSS
=========

A starter CSS template, written in SASS.

At the moment, this is a template I sometimes use to start web apps. There is no one framework that works best, so this is just one in the arsenal.

This isn't supposed to make stuff look pretty, it's just a base to start from with some common components. Very much in the same vein as Inuit and SuitCSS.
